Why take this course/tutorial?
So you can automate boaring and time consumming tasks just so you can be more lazy that you already are.

Why Nornir?
Shits easy man!

Do I need Python before taking this course?
Hell no, just copy the code, modify it to you liking, implement it in your company, get a promotion a raise, get a beer and chill.
If you want to do more complex stuff, of course python is the basis and is a must... come on man!!!

To everyone:
I will try to make this tutorials/projects as easy to understand as I can, so you can easily understand the fundamentals behind the code so you can quickly start implementing your own code on your company and hopefully help you in you day to day.

pos:
If you are wondering why my writing is so shit, english is not my native language!
