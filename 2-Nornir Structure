This is how the Nornir structure works and how you should save the files: 

Directory: NornirTest
  | Inventory:
    | defaults.yml
    | groups.yml
    | hosts.yml
  | Config.yml
  | nornirpythonscript.py
  

  To make this clear you need to create a folder, inside the folder you create: config.yml, the python script "nornirpythonscript" and another folder named Inventory.
  Inside the Inventory Folder you create: defaults.yml, groups.yml, hosts.yml files.
  
  Once you have all the code written just run the code:
  1- Go to the terminal and run the python script with the following command: python3 nornirpythonscript.py
