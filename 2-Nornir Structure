This is how the Nornir structure works and how you should save the files,
if you fail to save the files in this order, when you run the python script, the code wont be
able to find the absolute path of the .yml files where we have stored our hosts, groups and passwords.

Files Structure:

Directory: AnyName
  | Inventory:
    | defaults.yml
    | groups.yml
    | hosts.yml
  | Config.yml
  | nornirpythonscript.py
  

  To make this clear you need to create a folder, inside the folder you create: config.yml, the python script "nornirpythonscript.py" and another folder named Inventory.
  Inside the Inventory Folder you create: defaults.yml, groups.yml, hosts.yml files.
  
  Once you have all the code written and files created with the data and saved in the correct structure shown above, just run the code:
  1- Go to the terminal and run the python script with the following command: python3 nornirpythonscript.py
